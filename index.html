        So,I kicked it off at the age of 33..better late than sorry. I'm starting with the frontend. 
        But we'll see later on C#.
        Sure I've got some hobbies:
        <ul>
            <li>hobby 1 is knife and straight razor sharpening</li>
            <li>hobby 2 is english</li>
            <li>hobby 3 is travelling</li>
            <li>hobby 4 psychology,meditating and stuff like that</li>
        </ul>
        <p>some time later I'm gonna make over this CV so it looks much more sexy. But reading these lines
             is a unique chance to see the river starting with a stream</p>
